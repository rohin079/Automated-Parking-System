# Automated-Parking-System


## Project Description
>About the project-
This application will be capable of reading vehicle number plates. It will detect the numberplate on a vehicle with a camera, seperate out the number-plate and convert the image into a text string. This string will be stored on a database (google sheets), and the driver will be assigned a parking spot via mail. The data can be accessed and modified easily at a later date.
This gives you a powerful tool to manage and keep track of vehicles entering and exiting a premises. Through this application schools, universities, hospitals, airports and much more can be made much safer. You will also be able to check for the vehicle number on a given database and obtain information about the owner of the car, the model, etc. The application will count number of vehicles entering and exitting the gate, Note the time of entry and time of exit. Count the number of vehicles that are currently inside the premises and also assign a parking spot to the vehicle via mail.
